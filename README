README

clear state file and directory structure:

BasicGhostFluidSolver/ 				-  	data/
						- 	ExactSols/
						-	visualisation/
						*	BasicGhostFluidSolver.cpp
						*	TestCases_GhostFluid.H

RiemannGhostFluidSolver/ 			-  	data/
						- 	ExactSols/
						-	visualisation/
						*	RiemannGhostFluidSolver.cpp
						*	TestCases_GhostFluid.H


data/ is populated with solution data as the simulation runs

visualisation/ is the destination of graphics once files are compiled according to terminal instructions at the end of the simulation

ExactSols/ contains the data of the exact solutions from the Toro tests and other papers. This data was used for the versions of the plots generated in the report.

BasicGhostFluidSolver.cpp and RiemannGhostFluidSolver.cpp are the primary programs.
The main() function at the very bottom of both programs is where the user can specify the simulation settings. The program must be compiled with the header file: TestCases_GhostFluid.H
